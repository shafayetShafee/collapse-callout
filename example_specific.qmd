## Callout Blocks

:::{.callout-note collapse='true'}
### Note

Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
### Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.
:::

## More callout blocks

:::{.callout-caution}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
:::

:::{.callout-important}
## Important

This is important and it is not collapsible, since we didn't specify either `true` or `false` for `important` in our YAML header.
:::


:::{.callout-warning icon='false' collapse='false'}
## warning

WARNINGS !!!!
